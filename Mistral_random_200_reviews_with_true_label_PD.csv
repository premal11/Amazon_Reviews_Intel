Cleaned_Review,Sentiment
i bought this phone as a replacement for the exact same phone i know this is refurbished but the battery life is of my previous phone and when im on a phone call the calls sound very bad im actually very disappointed on this phones performance,Negative
bought phone june died already garbage,Negative
but within a couple of months they stopped working,Negative
replaced an aging motorolla g series with thus samsung battery life is not as good and samsung apps are a bit of a pain and are largely unrecoverable works well and seems to be bug free but well see how well it holds up,Neutral
the biggest problem is turning the yv on to often get a blank screen instead of the hdmi channel with my trusty roku on it the only thing i ever use the tv knows its there but upon choosing it repeatedly still blank the roku is on and responding to its remote it has its own flashing light still nothing and this is in my bedroom where i go when im tired grrr and i agree with the others the sound is subpar,Negative
i bought this phone to replace the same version it came completely dead which i thought was odd then after charging it for hours it only went up to battery then i picked it up and the phone was burning hot i have the same version of the phone already and i know it will charge in under an hour and never get hot like that its so much work to move all the apps and change everything over im beyond angry,Negative
if youve never purchased an unlocked phone make you have a sim card to use in this case i didnt have one that would work for this phone it took far longer than it should have to get it activated it wasnt the phone it was the different carriers i went to both complained that unlocked phones could be tricky etc it wasnt that it was the lack of support knowledge which transferred when i called my carriers customer service thankfully i finally got it activated its an awesome phone,Positive
im not impressed at all with this tv color isnt that great and is not easy to use a lot more steps to get into different apps wish the remote was laid out better,Negative
i originally bought this for my son to replace his blu r hd but he didnt care for it because the screen is too bright so i sat on it till my phone got stolen and i decided to switch over to this phone my phone service is through att and this phone is not really compatible with what they have going on according to att i need to get a new phone soon because its not going to work after they do some system update is what i was told anyway my biggest issue with it is i cant access any of my apps in the google play store to update them and even though i have automatic update selected it doesnt always work for all the apps one for sure it doesnt work on is google chrome and pinterest but the rest of the apps if you go to the google play store and search them you can update from that screen i also noticed quite a few times the time gets stuck on this like itll say and its actually the only way that i can fix that is to turn it off and turn it back on again the screen is really bright the battery is completely amazing it lasts forever and its durable because ive dropped it way too many times and the only problem i have is the glass protector screen they sent me has a crack in it but not the actual screen also the cameras kind of crappy and the filters dont work,Negative
nope i got this phone two weeks ago used for instead of paying for a new one huge mistake it said it was like new and showed signs of light use which is bs cause it completely sucks the charger it came with wasnt an htc charger it sucked wouldnt stay clicked into phone so if the phone moved at all even the tiniest bit when the charger was inside itd slip out and stop charging you gotta hold it at just the right angle and when you let go it stops charging like usually after a while the chargers get like that but from the start it was already like broken then the battery was terrible took so long for it to charge and within minutes it would drop down id charge my phone all night and wake up in the morning to it one hundred percent so id take it off and within like ten minutes its at okay those problems are annoying but what made me write this review was what happened today omg im so mad so my phone dies completely and turns off cause the battery sucks so i charged it while it was off till it was and go to turn it back on and this stupid white screen pops up that says locked and gives me options like system reboot factory reset lock sim but from the start the phones down button never worked so im using the up button to scroll through the options and in the screen it said power was to select but when id try it wouldnt do anything except stay on that stupid lock screen i had to call virgin mobile and since i couldnt get the msnidi think thats what its called the long barcode that every phone has customer service couldnt do anything for me they were like u can get the number off the box and the seller never sent me the box so theres no way for them to even connect to my phone so they give me htcs number and i had to call and talk to them and after about minutes of being passed around and put on hold a million times they did something to where i thought it was fixed cause the tech dude got my phone to reboot and i thought it was over but sure enough later in the day my phone died again and i got the same lock screen bs but of course after tech support is closed so this phone sucks used i basically threw in the trash do not buy unless youre buying it brand new,Negative
pretty to look at but piece of crap did arrive with all the bits n pieces powered up but then went haywirecrazy continuously flashing from screen to screen with no way to access the power off or reset buttons to shut it off unable to do a forced reboot unable to successfully boot in recovery mode unable to do a master reset as im on an international flight in less than hours and not back stateside for a while have no time to deal with returns basically a waste of money dont waste yours learn from the almost star reviews of total reviews on this itemsupplier samsung galaxy s gb unlocked phone international version maple gold mobiles international llc,Negative
stunning to look at but would not advise buying this phone quick enough to be fair but nothing special became laggy less impressive as the weeks passed after just months use i managed to drop mine in a case from less than off floor and screen cracked top to bottomhaving searched forums im not the only one with same experience yes i know should have been more careful but a premium phone should be more robust in my opinion i fear the curved edges result in a more fragile screen back to boring screen edges for me to be fair in use the screen edge bevel was more hindrance than helpbut looks stunning the choice is yoursform or function,Negative
tldr for lightmoderate use in very careful hands even with a case not for phone enthusiasts people who like customisingrooting do online banking or butterfingers if youve ever broken even one of your previous phones just look elsewhere maybe even at just a cheaper model worst customer service in history the weeks i used the phone sd card would not mount and read as internal storage only external dont know if that was a defect or something to do with their os tweaks annoying but not awful with the gb internal cant root this phone though i cant remember if it was because of their os or the malware bloatware takes up more space than youd expect reception with tmobile was just a little worse than my iphone about a bar change not awful fingerprint sensor worked about of the time but maybe my hands were too small for it sometimes people said it sounded like i was in a tunnel with the phone to my ear but not always couldve been something other than the phone bought of these one for me one for my grandma back in feb we both put cases on our phones my grandma has had issues with this phone she does light usage no more than hrs a day talktextwebetc she didnt buy an extended warranty doesnt hold the phone much and she loves it she upgraded from a samsung s or she feels banking on a phone is insecure anyway so she doesnt mind not being able to use it for bills etc when i launched the phone the first thing i did was buy the extended warrantyinsurance through the blu help app on the phone thats where the excitement about buying a new phone ended for me as right away i got no info about the warrantyinsurance even though the money was pulled out of my account not even the name of the company which i found very odd i had the phone for weeks before i dropped it i knew that would happen i break my phones very regularly so i wasnt too upset but i was surprised how much damage it caused the phone i was seated and it fell on tile and not only did the screen crack but the whole battery door got damaged as well it bent at the side buttons so its impossible to use any of them called blu for help to see who the insurer was they said they dont know dont offer buying warranties through their phones and cant be any further helprudely i might add and none of the women who tried to help me would listen to my problem they kept trying to give me solutions to other problems i didnt have after putting me on hold for min intervals without listening to what i was saying this was a while back but the specific instance i remember was i started out saying my screen wasnt working and before i could even say it was cracked she put me on hold and came back talking about how the phone might be defective no a screen crack isnt a defect that situation happened more times with the various women i was pretty upset then that blu couldnt tell me who was selling warrantiesinsurance on their own devices they told me to email blu instead of call never got a response called amazon they couldnt help me either in august i got an email from worth ave group with my info for my insurance then about weeks later i got an email with updated warranty info and they had downgraded my insurance from what i paid for so months between purchase of insurance before i got anything about my policy half the life of the policy was gone before i could maybe make a claim as soon as the info came in i tried to put a claim through impossible you call themcant access the website then they call you backyou have to leave a voicemail so i called numerous times different days at different times never heard anything back blu couldnt help they are known for shipping with malware and no phone ive ever had has broken so easilyexcept the iphone whose screen just randomly fell off the first week it was maybe a ft drop and the phone is literally unusable cracked all over unresponsive and like i said the battery door is broken so you cant even turn the screen off in order to fix the phone id have to find a battery door and a screen which leads to another downmark on this phone zero aftermarket parts for this phone even a website i saw through forums that was supposed official blu phone parts had no battery door covers of any kind and didnt offer a white screen only black so the rose gold version i purchased couldnt be restored anyway if you spend the money on an old samsunglgiphone at least you can fix certain things like if the screen cracks without worrying about warranties or bad customer service all that said i ordered the blu vivo xl used to replace this one for like at least if its destroyed its cheap to replace without worrying just like i have no trouble buying a zte phone if im in between phones and in a pinch a throwaway phone is a throwaway phone but such a nice flagship model shouldnt be forced into throwaway status because of such awful customer service all around overall its okay hours a day being all it can handle is a little annoying for just steer clear of their customer service and you probably wont hate it but its not a star phone,Negative
when i initially opened the box i was like wow this thing is brand new but when i went to turn it on it wouldnt even turn on so i was like wtf so i figured it must be completely dead so i went to charge it with the included charger and ctype cable and the it wouldnt go all the way in so i got a magnifying glass and looked at the charging port and there was all kinds of sand in it so i took a small pipe cleaning brush using some rubbing alcohol to clean the port out and let me tell you there was all kinds of crap in the charging port but i did finally get cleaned out with that and a can air then after that i let sit out for a few hours before trying to insert the ctype charging cable into the charging port and when i finally did that the ctype charging cable went easily into the charging port and the phone reported battery level and it took nearly hours to charge the phone crazy anyway for phone that is supposed to be renewed one shouldnt have to go through all that i had to go through anyway the phone is working now but battery performance isnt great i have it just sitting on the counter and i havent done anything with it no call no texts no nothing and in hours time it is down to which is all kinds of bad anyway i think i need to check the batteries performance level because my old pixel xl which i have sitting next to this renewed phone is at running the same apps as this renewed phone yeah i am thinking i just a renewed phone that was heavily used and the battery cant hold a very good charge anymore,Negative
ok so the battery never lasts more than hours an alert about the case not being closed and another for the charge port cover pop up all day probably draining the poor battery too if i have it in use for a minute phone call it dies as soon as i take it off charge it says minutes later the camera is impossible to focus its totally low quality waste of money really i thought i upgraded i had ztes before their battery seems to work great for months this phone the battery was a problem within days it came with weird advertising websites which seemed too pop up all the time on their own stuff i would have never searched for bad phone from day,Negative
in the middle of aug when i received last os update the wifi started acting weird and the device wasnt able to connect to any access point i feel i had been sold a bad hardware at the cost of new and genuine hardware this is cheating i should be mindful of buying any hardware from amazon next time,Negative
i have a strong dislike for this phone i bought it for my yr old son and he convinced me to trade him for my new lumia and i am regretting it already the phone doesnt keep a charge wont stay connected to the internet and i seem to never have a strong signal its not user friendly it drives me crazy unless youve had experience with this brand and already know you like it for some reason i would steer clear,Negative
i did purchase this product from amazon it was completely to my disatisfaction the box contained a used blackberry no installation cd and no case this was included when i placed the order im sorry to say i have been ripped off from this deal and i have been made to believe amazon has not satisfied the customer requirment and no longer can be trusted i am dissapointed,Negative
insanely slow and drops calls constantly,Negative
horrible workmanship ive ben using cell phones since years and have never run into such a cheaply constructed piece of plastic whats worse it is impossible to pry open the case to install the battery i even went to youtube for guidance and believe it there were videos on how to pry open the tribute but the phone used on youtube and this one are not the same the one they show does have a thumb nail slot the tribute does not have a thumb nail slot even the phones instructions omit the concept of opening the phone you know how they detail a phones features with a graphic there is no mention in the manual about a slot or opening for prying the case apart so i sent it right back i tried for an hour too the worst phone imaginable avoid,Negative
very nice phone for under i had the g before this and only upgraded after i finally killed the g by dropping it the camera is very nice high resolution screen and good fingerprint reader the phone is quick and i havent noticed any lag it comes with a basic plastic case and screen protector in addition to a charger and headphones i seriously doubt that the battery will actually last for days like they claim unless you hardly use the phone but im also it wont die in under a day with normal use so far this phone seems to stand up to blus normal standard of quality and useability came online with my net sim card immediately without any hiccups for anyone who is wondering these phones will work with just about any carrier except verizon grab one before theyre gone,Positive
great experience and picture quality,Positive
this smart phone is exceeding my expectations on speed responsiveness and features over a month owned and has performed flawlessly no fingerprint sensor but honestly i was having issues with apps closing due on my old moto e fingerprint scanning in error i use the pattern to unlock which is simple and quick to unlock my moto e play buy it while you can highly recommended,Positive
i was very happy with my galaxy s and thus had not considered upgrading until now with g being rolled out for real in many locations i was quite surprised however when i began using the multiple camera format of this device because i was convinced that improvements to the s camera were unlikely whoa so wrong the range of photographing capabilities have been significantly advanced in this model and i coudnt be happier with the results im seeing ai is in its infancy yet there are applications in the camera of this device that offer real advantages with impressive results also the much larger battery is doing a much better job of reaching the end of my typical day with power remaining for my purposes i am very glad that i decided to upgrade to the s and i highly recommend this model,Positive
i bought this cheap phone to use as a music player while ive purchased dedicated music players in the past with varying degrees of satisfaction i have found that a cheap cell phone excels works equally well or better my only issue with this particular phone is that the volume increments are not accurately spaced while the volume is adjustable there are times when its impossible to get the ideal volume level its either too high or too low but i found a volume control app online that mitigates the problem quite well,Neutral
camera is great on this phone if you switch between apps the bluetooth connection will drop,Neutral
student bought for college and i love it never had any issues with it runs games really well and doesnt crash or give me any issues when downloading modifications for anything either it lasts me all day during classes and has a great screen both for gaming and for my examshomeworkessays,Positive
easy to use,Positive
was leary purchasing refurbished but ive had no real problems except the face recognition feature doesnt like me but the biometric readers are great and more secure anyways battery life isnt great but not completely horrible just trying to get to where i knowunderstand the samsung features as most arent syncable with previous features but thats part of the process,Neutral
i dont often write reviews or give ratings but this product deserves it the lg inch class oled evo k is remarkable and at times has me memorized the pixel smoothing and detail is transformational and quickly transports you to the location on the screen i know im being wordy but really if you appreciate screen quality then this is the correct choice zero glare and picture quality that seems almost un improvable makes this the kind of experience you only get experience once i dont know how much better an k television can be and id never spend the extra money to find out because at best it would be marginal youll be happy like me with this purcashe,Positive
great phone for the price,Positive
very pleased needed to purchase a laptop to work from home it arrived super fast easy set up perfect for my needs seller was awesome,Positive
its a very good phone i brought this for my husband and he loves it highly recommend for anyone needing a good phone from att who is on a budget,Positive
if there was a flaw i couldnt find it looks and acts brand new worked seamlessly with our carrier tracfone super happy with this purchase,Positive
skeptical of the quality over time bought this to test it the hardware so far is rock solid phone is of exceptional build quality the screen fold is hardly noticeable the hinge feels firm when opening and closing the sound is decent the camera is great and it fits in my pocket however once you open up the flip whats on the screen just ruins the whole experience samsungs one ui they created is as bad as getting a phone from your carrier loaded with paid crap they shove onto it that slows it down and eats up your storage space and makes things way more difficult than they need to be until you just want to throw it away google already has most of the things in their android os base that you need samsung just recreates most of them badly the phone app lacks features the native android version has the messages app tries to make it look like imessage and theres the samsung store which is pushed upon you for all sorts of things from setting a background picture to installing more samsung apps you have no use for theres loads of features that are only available when you log the phone in to your samsung account i really dont need another worthless account to log my phone into thanks thankfully theres some really slick people at xda developers who make some programs that will allow you to disable all the bloatware and bs that comes on this phone as i have yes sixty one disabled samsung apps on this phone just to get it debloated and running smooth and fast and extend the battery life to what could be considered marginal without it i was out of battery by pm as every samsung app keeps trying to do something in the background all day long draining your battery if they had a clean install button that took out all the sht it would make this phone a immediately further time will tell on the fold and how that holds up over time,Neutral
excellent phone for the pricei havent used all the features theres a lot to phone i find tutorials on youtube great value for the money camera resolution on it is way better than any phone for this price,Positive
surprisingly easy to use and the system is fluent,Positive
good phone i like it reasonable price,Positive
i was a little hesitant to move to an arm based processor after doing some research watching reviews and looking at the applications i needed i felt confident in purchasing everything has worked really well i also purchased a tb micro ssd to put movies on as i plan to travel a lot battery lasts a long time without sacrificing performance,Positive
the unboxed the tv hooked it up and took the trash away they were both very pleasant and a pleasure to deal with aaaaa thank you,Positive
fingerprint reader works great until you add a screen protector then forget it my old s had the reader on the back and avoided this issue cant understand why they took something that worked well and changed it i also preferred the screen press over the double tap to wake the phone up battery life memory camera etc are all great and i recommend this phone as long as fingerprint reader is not a deal breaker for you the phone is like new and the delivery was fast would buy again from this seller,Positive
i bought this phone months ago and really like it its a fantastic value for the price was really happy with the phone then i updated to android i really wish i hadnt and you cant roll back the wifi has become glitchy the battery life is still good but not quite as good and the phone overall moves slower i dont see a single improvement or benefit to android im writing this as a caution to those who havent upgraded yet anyone else having issues since upgrading this phone,Neutral
convenient charger and the common charging plug nice looking case,Positive
have only had it for a couple of days but great battery life easy to move all my stuff from old galaxy phone to this one great value for the price,Positive
the phone arrived with the original packaging paper inserts usbc cable and warp charger everything it came with looked like it had never been used and works perfectly the battery life has been excellent and the warp charger charges the phone from in less than minutes,Positive
i really like this phone for the price it works just as well as my nexus that i had previously used the camera is not very great but decent the size is perfect the sound is ok i feel the volume on loud speaker could be better i enjoy the pink color which is fun only regret is not purchasing the lte version i maybe doing that soon so the data speed is faster i am currently using the cricket plan and i am satisfied,Neutral
i returned it immediately but refund will take days,Negative
bought one for me n mum within couple days of each other rubbish avoid same issues with both,Negative
it did not and required another purchase the options given was for days for and for year add this into you calculation,Negative
i did receive my item very quicklyi did have issues with it when i first bought it i had difficulty hearing when i received or tried to call someone using the phone i did contact customer support they sent a link for me to contact apple as they were the manufacture apple did set me up with an appointment to have it checked out they did fix the sound issue but also told me i had faulty microphone so evidently everything is not exactly checked out to make it like new when you buy a renewed phone this was the second pro that i bought through amazon amazon the first one i sent right back on that note i do like the phone i think i will try out my phone for a bit to see if i have any more issues before i see if i need to send it back it does have a warranty i did buy an otterbox case for it which i like really well i hope this helps anyone that is looking for a phone,Neutral
im only giving stars because i have the tv ive notvyet installed it but im sure it will preform well my complaint is that it came with no operating instructions,Neutral
i bought one in good condition and came with a big scratch in the flip blocked to att and with a problem on the screen that shut down when flipping anyway i just return it and the store helped me quickly so i will give them that got my refund and all in good time at least the store is there because this happens with renewed phones,Neutral
it is an old model and tmobile was able to activate my service there,Positive
when we open the package the phone was unlocked did not have to set the phone up which was highly suspicious and weird did not trust that so i factory restarted the whole phone and works fine bought the phone for my brother he stats that the phone is good feels like it was bought brand spanking new rated it stars because it was unlocked fully,Positive
was good value but the redmi i got even though international version was not compatible with cricket wireless,Neutral
you need to get this the u is basically the same as the u and absolutely smokes the u in gaming very light gaming but beats both in multithreading applications the u is a ct cpu where as the u and u are a ct cpu but the u is slightly worse than the u you definitely get more bang for your buck with the u ps the only downside is that there is only one slot for storage and its a mini m nvme but it looked like you could upgrade to a full size m drive also there is gb of ram soldered to the motherboard but it does have an empty slot to put an gb stick of ram i would get one thats mhz cl theyre like and will drastically improve the performance,Neutral
i bought one of these unlocked cell phones motorola razr unlocked international version theyre unlocked only in the strictest sense of the word these phones are branded meaning theyve got some carriers logo on them and more importantly theyve got a crippled version of the phone software now the razr is a very cool phone but its only as good as the software that makes it actually work the att software i had would not allow you to make separate profiles and it required you to log on to only the att network to get ring tones wallpaper etc all fine if youre an att customer but this completely misses the point of buying an unlocked cell phone in the first place i tried to fix the situation by reflashing ie putting on generic useful software that comes with a truly unlocked phone see eg as soon as i did that the phone seized up and demanded a subsidy password the phone really wasnt unlocked at all if you want a phone that is truly unlocked and unbranded buy it from one of the european amazon sites youll spend a little more but youll get what you actually want in the end,Negative
i dont want cricket carrie i just want unlocked iphone,Neutral
this is mostly a review on either amazon or oneplus fulfillment abilities at the moment i put in an order for an ultramarine blue pro two weeks ago only for my order to get delayed and to put salt on the wound i finally got the package today only to reveal a standard in interstellar glow not sure who screwed up here but im just letting anyone interested know that getting theses phones in your hands is a process right now will update once i finally get the correct device update received the correct phone within the same week amazon guarantees that you will receive the correct item within business days of receiving the returned item which seems to happen even if its out of stock they must have some in reserve just in case say what you will about amazon but their customer service is top notch if youre deciding between ordering off of onepluss website vs amazon definitely go amazon for their service and accountability stock still seems to be an issue so if youre willing to wait a month or so for that to steady im sure you will encounter a much smoother experience than i did the phone itself absolutely flies and the ultramarine is straight up gorgeous quite an upgrade from my chugging galaxy s however no phone is worth the price premium gougers are charging when out of stock the wait will be worth it overall id rate everything a but amazon doesnt do half stars,Positive
its ok,Neutral
i thought the writing across the headphones was a sticker i could pull off,Neutral
i paid bucks for this bundle using the amazon store card brand new never used trio of products never had a sony phone before it works fine and has android pie and probably wont upgrade any further it is a heavy phone going from a blu vivo air lte which was probably the thinnest lightest phone in existence about years ago the wireless headphones work fine although could be considered somewhat delicate have not used the tilt case yet and probably wont jesus dont pay for this unless you are made of money and must have a sony xa,Negative
first there are better laptops for the cost but you will be seeing and inch screens when looking for those this is a mediocre performing screen but it is a excellent inch p screen you can play some games on it on the lowest settings but that isnt why you get this guy you get it because of the screen size and work as a work computer there are somethings that are also mediocre the ram isnt the problem as the u processor was upgraded to support ddr however the u processor is also mediocre wherein the processor is a zen processor with only cores and threads threads total as each core hosts two threads the zen is a functional processor node though but it is a old one think back on the ryzen series processors there is a light though though dim and that is the rdna gpu it is a onboard m gpu which is standard in the lineup that are not g series processors it has stream processors unified shader cores think cuda from nvidia this is not a lot of gpu power though as a g series processor could have up to stream processors what is weird is that they added ray tracing cores onto this gpu which confuses me as i see nothing that would work well with and likely this is ripped from a larger gpu cluster and made into a module this is great though for video web based games and things like accounting or other work requiring numbers or typing there is a number pad and another mediocre part the keyboard there is a lot of flex in the keyboard especially in the middle i opened it up to find minimal bracing and the motherboard directly below the keyboard so no hulk smash of the keyboard less you want a broken one interesting notes though there isnt much for upgrades here you can upgrade the network card and the nvme ssd drive repairability is higher though with separate daughter board for the left io ports usb audio as well as the power port not being on the motherboard making the proprietary cord for power a bit easier to repair in the future if or when it breaks though i do wish that they allowed for charging through the usb port that was a letdown to find it does not charge through the usbc port which means i can not use my dock to charge it also means they did not make use of usbc which is not native to the processor which only support gen opening it up though did reveal a good system for removing heat allowing that there is proper clearance under the unit i was happy with the cooling solution though and even think it was more than actually required the motherboard used quality parts and i love that they are repurposing a battery for a more universal fit situation this decreases cost for hp and increases options for repair in the future the ssd was a samsung unit looked like it was a all in one controller with a side ddr memory module either that or the module was the controller and it was ddrless but i trust samsung as a part and think this is a good one to have all in one controller for nvme means that both the nvme processor and memory are found on one unit first instance i found of this was small nvme units from kioxia formerly known as toshiba inside the hp there wasnt anything i was really disappointed at though with one exception the exception was the screen hinges the hinge system reminded me of hp engineering of the late s think hp was one of the worst companies at that point as a tech that had to repair them but by i was seeing more and more options that were great getting back to the hinges there may not be a problem if they tuned the tension correctly however they are using the same setup of metal inside plastic housing and i have seen so many times how that fails requiring replacement of part of the laptops body and sometimes even the screen or wire harness there is no additional bracing to prevent flex in the area as well though the bottom is deep and works well another thing repairing this will require that you remove the bottom feet to access five hidden screws once out and tight line on the upper section of the body attaches the bottom to the top of the body assembly via clips guitar picks and plastic pry tools will be required to gently coax the two halves apart the good news is you only have to open this unit up for repairs only and likely well past the warranty there is no major reason to be accessing the inside when so little inside is capable of upgrades or replacement the screen on this inch laptop is actually the best part of this unit things like keyboard flex and unmentioned till now key mushiness are likely the worst things for this laptop other things like underwhelming processor are more of a amd thing though is a great entry to a new laptop when i first got this they were talking about for the price and that is not worth it now it is as of writing this while not being on sale and that is a better price though i was thinking when i was looking at it part wise so i was close only thing i would be considering as a worry point is those screen hinges though i would love to see some sort of structural brace inside these in the future though where that would help with the keyboard flex little bonus this unit does have a built in camera shutter so you can manually close the camera off sound on this isnt stellar but it is good overall for what it is i can recommend it at but with the caveat of watching the pressure you put on the screen when opening it if you do want better than this laptop you will be looking at either smaller ones older models or larger cost units,Neutral
reason for the ruku purchase instead of samsung or sony was because you cant buy a normal tv anymore without the smart bloatware in it i always end up buying a ruku stick anyways so i get to skip that step and just the tv with ruku built in it so far im satisfied with my purchase,Positive
the size is larger but it doesnt feel larger the best fingerprint reader yet,Neutral
i bought this during black friday sale for us before taxes i kind of relied on the reviews specially the one by rtings the main reason i chose this is because it supposedly had the best pricetobrightness ratio i completely made up the term here i placed it in a bright room directly opposite to the big window so tv had have good brightness and good antiglare while the tv can get quite bright increasing the brightness causes the picture to get washed to the point it is unwatchable antiglare or whatever the technical term is is decent but not great in general picture quality is decent but definitely wobt blow anyones mind one persistent problem i have with the tv is the bluetooth connectivity i exclusively use bl headphones to watch but if my bl headphone gets disconnected i have to unpair my headphones from the tv and then repair it there is no simple reconnect option which seems like a nobrainer dont know if this an android issue or hisense issue also i dont understand why i have to have a hisense account to connect my echo show to the tv that seems unnecessarily stupid other than that my experience has been good the tv hasnt shown any unstability issues hulu has hiccupped few times but other than that it has been completely fine for dollars this is not a bad purchase,Neutral
would be better if the screen werent so glitchy,Neutral
but i didnt read the description so i had to return it ali thought i was buying a brand new phone but it was preloved one my apologies to the seller and thank you for your understanding,Positive
before purchasing a laptop i looked around to weigh the options this one ticked all my boxes although yours may be different it said it came with win home it does not it comes with win in safe mode not a huge deal getting it out of safe mode is relatively easy once out of safe mode you can dl a good browser install it and then youll have to go into the settings network and internet browser and change the default browser to your preference this is the only reason i didnt give it stars and only because doing this takes time and patience if you havent before the description should be changed i read a review that said it wouldnt support an external monitor from usb but that isnt true i connected a separate touchscreen external monitor to it and it works fine it takes a usb to usb c cable and a hdmi cable to work and its worth mentioning i am not a computer genius or tech savvy by any means the laptop is quite thin and lightweight which is important to those on the go i am not on the go anymore so it doesnt affect me but i want to be impartial im not a fan of win but after a couple of days it is at least navigable i did spend those couple of days just turning things off like reporting to microsoft every little detail it seems theres a dozen or so of these settings that can be difficult to find wonder why they did that all in all i am happy with the laptop and hope it does its job in the future i would recommend it to others for sure as long as they know they need to modify it to release the better features,Neutral
as advertised the internet connection make the tv functions like a roku channel videos are dated not current stuff,Negative
purchased the for under i like that samsung tv makes it easy to watch free tv like national news setup was easy with wifi or ethernet cable the remote isnt great coming from a roku premier with radio having to point the ir remote is annoying i was also surpised it didnt have a voice search button it works with samsung smart things and has a smartphone remote option it paired nicely with my denon avr to get surround sound using hdmi arc after an audio setting change the first one came smashed which was dissapointing but easily replaced they picked up the return insted of having to drop it off,Neutral
